## Steps

1. Blanch the pork bones in boiling water for 10 minutes, then drain and rinse under cold water to remove impurities.
2. Place cleaned bones in a large pot with fresh water, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
3. Reduce to a vigorous simmer and cook for 10-12 hours, adding water as needed to keep bones submerged. The broth should turn creamy white.
4. Combine soy sauce and mirin in a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer for 5 minutes to cook off the alcohol. Set tare aside.
5. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding solids. Season with salt to taste.
6. Cook ramen noodles according to package directions. Drain well.
7. Ladle tare into bowls, add hot broth, then noodles. Top with halved soft-boiled eggs and sliced green onions.

<Tip>For extra richness, add a split pig's foot to the broth.</Tip>
