## Steps

1. In the stand mixer bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and crumbled yeast. Mix with the dough hook.
2. Pour in 3/4 of the eggs and the milk, and knead until smooth.
3. Add the remaining eggs and knead on speed 2 for 5 to 10 minutes until the dough pulls away from the sides.
4. Cut the cold butter into cubes and incorporate it gradually on speed 1.
5. Once fully combined, knead for 10 to 15 minutes on speed 2 until the dough pulls away from the sides.
6. Shape the dough into a ball. Cover and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place.
7. Refrigerate for 18 hours.
8. Preheat the oven to 50°C.
9. Punch down the dough and shape the brioche as desired.
10. Turn off the oven and place the brioche inside for 30 minutes with the door slightly ajar.
11. Remove the brioche from the oven and preheat to 220°C (or 175°C for flat pieces).
12. Mix a little egg (yolk or whole), cream, and sugar, and brush the brioche.
13. Sprinkle with coarse sugar crystals if desired.
14. Lower the oven temperature to 175°C and bake immediately for 25 minutes.

## Praline brioche variation

1. Roll out the dough, place the pralines in the center, and fold the 4 corners to enclose them.
2. Lightly dusting with flour, give 2 single folds. Shape into a ball and let the dough rise as described above.
3. For baking, after the 25 minutes at 175°C, lower the oven to 150°C and bake for an additional 20 minutes.

<Tip>The crushed pralines are optional. Without them, you get a classic brioche.</Tip>
