## Puff Pastry

1. Gently melt the butter in the microwave. It should not separate. Let it return to room temperature.
2. Sift the flours into a large bowl.
3. Mix the water, salt, and vinegar until the salt dissolves.
4. Combine everything without overworking until a ball forms.
5. Roll out into a 35 x 20 cm template, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
6. Roll out the lamination butter into a 15 x 18 cm template, tapping it with a rolling pin if needed. Refrigerate.
7. Place the butter in the center of the détrempe, and fold the dough over the butter. Seal the openings. Perform 2 single turns, brushing off excess flour each time. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
8. Perform 2 single turns, brushing off excess flour each time. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
9. Perform 2 single turns, brushing off excess flour each time. Set aside in the fridge.

## Tender Apples

1. Peel and core the apples. Cut them into quarters.
2. Bring the water to a boil with the lemon juice. Add the apples, bring back to a boil. Turn off the heat, cover for 10 minutes. Drain.
3. Make a dry caramel, heating to approximately 185°C.
4. Add the butter and salt, and mix as smoothly as possible.
5. Add the lemon juice, then pour into a génoise mold.
6. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
7. Cut the apple quarters into thin slices. Arrange them on the caramel, to a thickness of 1.5 cm.
8. Bake for 20 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil, then bake for 60 minutes.
9. Refrigerate overnight.

## Whipped Vanilla Ganache

1. Scrape the vanilla seeds. Place them in the heavy cream (optionally with the pod shell).
2. Bring the cream to a simmer, and turn off the heat immediately. Cover and let infuse for 2 hours.
3. Rehydrate the gelatin with the water, set aside in the fridge.
4. Bring the cream back to a simmer.
5. Emulsify with the chocolate in 3 additions.
6. Add the rehydrated gelatin, and mix until smooth.
7. Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

## Assembly

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C.
2. Roll out the puff pastry to 3 mm, using the powdered sugar.
3. Place it on a baking sheet, making sure it cannot rise above 1 cm thickness during baking.
4. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes.
5. Let cool, then cut 3 equal rectangles using a bread knife.
6. Whip the ganache until it reaches a firm whipped cream consistency.
7. Cut the apples into cubes and arrange them on the puff pastry, alternating with piped ganache. Stack the pastry layers. Carefully decorate the top layer.
