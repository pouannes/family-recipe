## Rousquille dough

1. Sift the flour, baking powder, powdered sugar and salt into a bowl.
2. Cut the butter into cubes and rub into the dry ingredients until sandy.
3. Mix the egg yolks, honey and orange blossom water.
4. Bring everything together into a rough dough.
5. Roll out the dough to 6mm thick, and rest for 2 hours in the fridge.
6. Preheat the oven to 160°, convection mode.
7. Cut into rings 2cm wide, 7.5cm in diameter.
8. Bake for 15 minutes, let cool on a wire rack.

## Lemon glaze

1. Preheat the oven to 100°, convection mode.
2. Mix all the glaze ingredients together — you should get a semi-fluid paste.
3. Dip each rousquille into the glaze. It should be entirely coated.
4. Place all the rousquilles on a wire rack. They must not touch each other.
5. Turn off the oven and place the rousquilles inside to dry for 30 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven, let cool completely to room temperature.
7. Store in an airtight container.
