## Marinade

1. In a bowl, mix the juice of one small lemon, 600 g of chicken, one teaspoon of chili powder and one teaspoon of salt. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.

2. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, one teaspoon of chili powder, the garlic-ginger paste and the garam masala.

3. Mix the chicken into the yogurt marinade, add the mustard oil and refrigerate for 4 hours.

## Tomato sauce

4. Roughly chop the tomatoes and blend them into a puree.

5. Pour the puree into a non-stick pan, rinse the blender with a little water and add it to the pan.

6. Add the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods and salt. Cover and let it thicken.

7. Finely mince the ginger, garlic and chili. Add them to the pan and continue cooking over medium heat.

8. Strain the tomato sauce through a fine sieve to remove the spices and aromatics.

## Finishing

9. In the non-stick pan (now emptied), cook the chicken.

10. In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat the butter and one tablespoon of oil.

11. Fry the garlic-ginger paste. Add the tomato sauce, passata, fenugreek seeds and honey.

12. When the chicken is almost cooked, add a little oil and sear it until golden.

13. Add the chicken, cream, cilantro leaves and cashew nuts blended with water to the sauce.

<Tip>
  The 4-hour marinade is essential to tenderize the chicken and build flavor.
  Plan accordingly.
