## Rice

1. Rinse the rice in cold water for a few minutes, until the water runs clear.
2. Drain the rice well, and place it in a saucepan with the 135g of water.
3. Cover the saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat.
4. Meanwhile, put the remaining ingredients (vinegar, sugar, mirin, salt, kombu) in a small saucepan and heat until the sugar and salt are dissolved.
5. When the rice water boils, stir the rice with a spoon and unstick it from the bottom. Lower the heat, and cover again.
6. When all the water has been absorbed by the rice, turn off the heat and leave covered for 10 minutes.
7. Pour the rice into a wide dish, pour the vinegar mixture over it and mix gently. Spread it out evenly, and let it rest uncovered for 10 minutes.
8. Turn the rice over in small portions so that what was against the dish is now exposed to the air. Let rest for 10 minutes.

## Sushi

1. Cut the salmon into 3 long strips, and each avocado half into 6 pieces.
2. Sprinkle the rice with sesame seeds.
3. Take a nori sheet, and place it in front of you with the long side parallel to you.
4. Spread one third of the rice over it, leaving the quarter closest to you bare.
5. At the edge of the rice, lay a strip of salmon and 3 pieces of avocado.
6. Roll gently but tightly, starting from the side closest to you.
7. Cut into 8 pieces.
