## Steps

1. Place all the ingredients in the stand mixer bowl and beat for 10 minutes with the dough hook, gradually increasing the speed.

2. If everything has not come together, add very little water.

3. Shape the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.

4. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces.

5. Flour generously, roll out and cut into the desired shape.

6. Let dry for 1 to 24 hours, then store in an airtight container.

<Tip>The 2-hour rest in the refrigerator is important to allow the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to roll out.</Tip>
