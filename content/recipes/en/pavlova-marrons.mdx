## Vanilla whipped ganache

1. In a saucepan, place the vanilla pod, its seeds and the cream. Bring to a simmer, then immediately turn off the heat. Cover for 1 hour to let it infuse.
2. Rehydrate the gelatin with the water, set aside in the fridge.
3. Bring the cream back to a simmer. Emulsify with the chocolate in 3 additions.
4. Add the rehydrated gelatin and mix until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap in contact with the surface, refrigerate overnight.

## Chestnut insert

1. Rehydrate the gelatin, mix well, and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
2. Blend the two creams together. Warm slightly in the microwave, then add the gelatin mixture. Mix until smooth. Add the candied chestnut pieces.
3. Pour into 6 cm diameter rings, and refrigerate for 12 hours.

## French meringue

1. Take the egg whites out 1 to 2 hours in advance so they reach room temperature.
2. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks, starting at low speed and increasing every 1 to 2 minutes. Each time, add a little vanilla sugar.
3. When they are very firm, add the remaining vanilla sugar and the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth.
4. Pipe onto 7 cm diameter half-sphere molds, trying to flatten the base.
5. Pipe a few extra teardrop shapes.
6. Bake for 2 hours at 100°C.

## Chestnut vermicelli

1. Mix the cream and paste until you obtain a smooth mixture.

## Assembly

1. Whip the ganache.
2. Place the meringue domes hollow side up.
3. Fill up to 1 cm from the edge with whipped ganache.
4. Place the insert.
5. Cover with whipped ganache, forming a dome.
6. Pipe the chestnut vermicelli.
7. Decorate with a large candied chestnut, meringue teardrops and candied chestnut pieces.
