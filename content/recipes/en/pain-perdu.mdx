## Preparation

1. In a small saucepan, bring the cream and vanilla to a boil. At the first bubble, turn off the heat, cover, and let infuse for 30 minutes (if using a pod; for extract, no need to wait 30 minutes).
2. Beat the two egg yolks with the sugar without aerating. Add the vanilla cream.
3. In a large dish, lay out the bread slices and pour the custard over them. Refrigerate for 24 hours (at least 1 hour).
4. Heat a pan over medium-high heat with the butter. Brown the bread on both sides.
5. Sprinkle sugar on the top side, flip the bread and let it caramelize. Repeat on the other side. Serve.

<Tip>Heat the remaining custard for 1 hour at 100°C in crème brûlée ramekins.</Tip>
