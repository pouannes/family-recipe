## Sweet Pastry

1. Cream the butter and powdered sugar.
2. Add the egg and mix until smooth.
3. Sift the almond powder, salt, and flour. Mix briefly, stopping as soon as you can form a ball.
4. Roll out half to 3mm thickness and the other half to 2mm thickness. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
5. Line the bases with the 3mm dough and the sides with the 2mm dough. Refrigerate overnight.

## Almond, Basil, and Orange Cream

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C, convection mode.
2. Make the pastry cream: bring the milk to a simmer. Whisk the egg yolk, cornstarch, and sugar. Gradually pour the milk over the yolk mixture, stirring constantly. Return to the saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir continuously, removing from heat after one minute of boiling. Pour into a bowl. At around 40°C, add the butter (3.5 g) in small pieces and mix with a spatula until smooth. Cover and refrigerate.
3. Bake the tart shells for 15 minutes.
4. Cream the soft butter and powdered sugar. Add the almond powder and cornstarch.
5. Add the egg and mix until smooth.
6. Fold one tablespoon of this mixture into 60 g of pastry cream. Mix well. Repeat twice more, then combine everything.
7. Add the Cointreau and mix.
8. Add the basil, zest, and candied orange, and stir to distribute evenly.
9. Fill each tart shell with 40 g of the mixture.
10. Carefully remove the rings.
11. Bake for 10 minutes at 160°C. The almond cream should be lightly golden.

## Silky Blood Orange and Basil Cream

1. Rehydrate the gelatin in the cold water. Set aside in the refrigerator.
2. Cook the juices, zest, basil, sugar, and eggs in a double boiler.
3. Stir regularly until reaching 82°C, then remove from heat.
4. Add the gelatin and mix until smooth.
5. At 60°C, emulsify the butter into the rest of the mixture.
6. Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface and refrigerate overnight.

## Orange Jelly

1. Combine everything in a saucepan. Bring to a boil while whisking.
2. Pour into a frame to 0.5 cm thickness. Let set for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
3. Cut into 0.5 cm cubes.

## Assembly

1. Using a piping bag with a 10mm tip, pipe large dollops of silky cream onto the tart bases.
2. Decorate with the orange jelly cubes, blood orange segments, zest, and basil.
