## Shortcrust Pastry

1. Mix 45 g of flour with all ingredients except the couverture.
2. As soon as the mixture is smooth, add the remaining flour (133 g) and mix until you get a coarse mixture.
3. Roll out to 3 mm thickness and let rest for 30 minutes in the fridge.
4. Line the square rings. Let rest for 1 hour in the fridge.
5. Preheat the oven to 150°C.
6. Dock the tart bases and bake for 25-30 minutes.
7. When out of the oven, place a few couverture discs on top and brush with a pastry brush once melted. Remove the rings.

## Lemon Cream

1. In a saucepan, combine the lemon juice, zest, egg, egg white, and sugar.
2. Over high heat, whisk vigorously until thickened.
3. Immediately pour over the white chocolate and emulsify.
4. Fill the tart bases and smooth with a spatula.

## Lemon-Basil Jelly

1. Bloom the gelatin in the cold water (5 g).
2. In a small saucepan, combine the zest, lemon juice, water (50 g), sugar, agar-agar, and basil leaves.
3. Bring to a boil, add the gelatin, and let infuse for 10 minutes.
4. Strain and pour into a container to obtain a jelly about 1 cm thick.
5. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
6. Once the jelly has set, cut into cubes and arrange on the tartlets.

<Tip>You can replace the basil with mint, tarragon, or rosemary.</Tip>
