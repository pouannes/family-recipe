## The shells

1. Toast the almond flour for 10 minutes in the oven at 150°C.

3. Gradually whip 40 g of egg whites to stiff peaks, adding the granulated sugar (3.6 g).
4. Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar.
5. When the syrup reaches 118°C, pour it into the whites by letting it run down the side of the bowl, while continuing to whisk at medium speed.
6. Add the remaining 40 g of egg whites and whisk for 20 seconds.
7. Replace the whisk with the paddle, add the sifted dry ingredients and mix on low speed for 30 seconds.
8. Preheat the oven to 130°C, with a rack and a perforated baking sheet on top.
