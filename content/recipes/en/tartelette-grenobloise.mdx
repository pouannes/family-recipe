## The Sweet Pastry

1. Cream the butter and powdered sugar. Add the almond powder and salt.
2. Add the egg in 3 additions. Mix until smooth.
3. Add the flour all at once and stop mixing as soon as a dough forms.
4. Roll out to 3mm, refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
5. Line the rings, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
6. Preheat the oven to 150°C, dock the bases, and bake for 25 minutes.

## Dried Fruit Caramel

1. In a small saucepan, bring the cream and vanilla to a simmer.
2. In another saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and glucose syrup, and make a caramel to 185°C.
3. Turn off the heat, add the cream, mix well with a whisk, then bring everything back to 110°C over medium heat.
4. Transfer to a container and let cool. At 35°C, add the butter and salt, and mix until smooth.
5. Combine with the toasted dried fruits (warm the caramel to help if needed), then pour into the tart shells.
6. Let set in the refrigerator.
