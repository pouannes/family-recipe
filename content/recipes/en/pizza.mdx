## Pizza Dough

1. Heat the oven to 50°C fan-assisted.

2. Mix the yeast, sugar, and warm water until everything is dissolved. Let rest for 10 minutes.

3. In the stand mixer bowl, add the previous mixture and the rest of the dough ingredients.

4. Beat on first speed for 5 minutes, then use a spatula to thoroughly detach the dough from the sides of the bowl.

5. Turn off the oven and keep the door closed.

6. Beat on second speed for 5 minutes, then on third speed for 5 minutes. By the end, the dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl.

7. Insert the spatula between one side of the bowl and the dough, then lift the spatula and fold the small amount of dough that stuck to it over to the other side of the bowl.

8. Repeat this motion about ten times to create surface tension.

9. Cover the dough and let it rest for 2 hours in the turned-off oven.

## Tomato Sauce

1. Slice the garlic and onion.

2. Core the tomatoes, remove the stems, and cut the tomatoes into small pieces.

3. In a large skillet, heat the oil and garlic over high heat.

4. When the garlic starts to brown, add the onion. Stir regularly.

5. Let the onion brown slightly, then add the tomatoes.

6. Stir regularly. If the bottom tends to burn, lower the heat. Continue cooking until no more water is visible.

7. Chop the basil. When the tomato sauce is done, turn off the heat, add the basil, and mix.

## Baking the Pizza

1. Preheat the oven to 250°C with bottom heat and fan. Place a baking sheet inside.

2. On parchment paper, stretch the dough by pulling it. It should be just under 30 x 40 cm. Use the flour to prevent it from sticking to your fingers.

3. Spread the tomato sauce in a thin layer.

4. Add toppings and cheese to your liking.

5. Bake for about 13 minutes (start checking from 10 minutes).

<Tip>The 2-hour rest in the turned-off oven (preheated to 50°C) allows for a slow and gentle rise of the dough.</Tip>
