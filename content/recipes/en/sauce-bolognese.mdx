## Steps

1. Mince the garlic, dice the onions, carrots and celery into 1 cm cubes.

2. In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil and garlic over high heat.

3. When the garlic starts to brown, add the onion. Stir regularly until the onion is golden.

4. Add the lardons and caramelize them, stirring frequently.

5. Add the carrots and celery, and do the same.

6. Pour in the white wine and let it evaporate, stirring regularly.

7. Add the ground beef and caramelize it, stirring regularly.

8. When all the water has evaporated, pour in the passata, water and cream.

9. Let it reduce, stirring regularly and gradually lowering the heat.

10. Once the desired consistency is reached (this will take between 1h30 and 4h depending on the heat), transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate or freeze.

<Tip>The longer the sauce simmers, the more flavorful it will be. Allow at least 1h30 but ideally 3 to 4h over low heat.</Tip>
