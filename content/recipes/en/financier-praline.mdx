3. Fold the room-temperature egg whites into the sifted dry ingredients, then mix until smooth.
4. Add the butter-honey mixture and 14 g of praline, and mix well.
5. Let rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
6. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
7. Fill the molds with batter and pipe a little praline (the remaining 15 g) into the center.
8. Sprinkle with crushed hazelnuts and brown sugar.
9. Bake for 27 minutes.
