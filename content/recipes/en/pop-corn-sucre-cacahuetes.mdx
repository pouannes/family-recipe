## Preparation

1. Place a large saucepan over high heat with the kernels and oil. Stir to coat the kernels with the oil.
2. When the first kernel pops, cover the pan and lower the heat to medium. Shake the pan from time to time.
3. When the last "pop" is more than 5 seconds apart, transfer the popped corn into a large bowl.
4. In a small saucepan, place the butter, sugars, glucose and vanilla over medium heat.
5. At 121°C, turn off the heat, add the baking soda and peanuts and stir quickly to distribute evenly.
6. Pour everything over the popcorn and stir vigorously to coat all the kernels.
