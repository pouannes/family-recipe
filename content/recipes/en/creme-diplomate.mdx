## Pastry cream

1. For a vanilla cream: scrape the vanilla seeds and add them to the milk along with the pod. For an orange blossom cream: mix 200 g of orange blossom water with 30 g of whole milk powder.
2. Bring the milk to a simmer. Let infuse for 2 hours for the vanilla version.
3. Rehydrate the gelatin in 10 g of cold water. Refrigerate.
4. Mix the sugar, yolks, and cornstarch.
5. Bring the milk to a simmer and gradually add it to the previous mixture.
6. Pour everything back over medium heat, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil for 3 minutes.
7. Off the heat, add the gelatin and mix well.
8. Let cool. When the mixture reaches about 40°C, add the butter cut into cubes and mix until smooth.
9. Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

## Assembly

10. Loosen the mixture with a whisk.
11. Whip the cream to soft peaks and fold it in gradually.

<Tip>Orange blossom variation: replace the vanilla bean and milk with 200 g of orange blossom water and 30 g of milk powder.</Tip>
