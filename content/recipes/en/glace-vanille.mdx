## Preparation

1. Scrape the vanilla seeds and place them with the pod and milk in a saucepan over medium heat.
2. When the milk begins to simmer, turn off the heat, stir well to disperse the vanilla seeds, and cover the saucepan. Let rest for about 2 hours.
3. Add the vanilla extract to the saucepan and turn on low heat.
4. Whisk together the yolks, sugar, milk powder and stabilizer until the mixture lightens in color.
5. When the milk begins to simmer, gradually pour it over the yolks while whisking well each time.
6. Return to medium heat, stirring continuously until the mixture reaches 85°C.
7. Immediately strain into a container, add the cold cream and mix.
8. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Churn.
