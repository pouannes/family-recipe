## Chocolate Sweet Pastry

1. Cream the butter and powdered sugar. Add the hazelnut powder and salt.
2. Pour in the eggs and mix until smooth.
3. Add the flour and melted chocolate. Mix briefly without overworking.
4. Roll out half the dough to 3mm, and the other half to 2mm. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
5. Line the square frames, using the thick dough for the base and the thin dough for the sides.
6. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
7. Bake for 20 minutes at 160°C (check doneness).

## The Praline

1. Place the sugar and water in a small pan. Make an amber caramel.
2. When the caramel reaches the right color, turn off the heat, add the hazelnuts, and coat them thoroughly in the caramel. Transfer onto a baking mat.
3. Let it harden, then blend until you obtain a praline paste.
4. Melt the chocolate with the butter, add to the praline.
5. Spread the praline into each tart base.

## The Chocolate Ganache

1. Gently melt the chocolate.
2. Warm the glucose and cream until they reach 40°C (like a very warm bath).
3. Emulsify with the chocolate in 3 additions.
4. Add the diced butter and salt. Mix until smooth.
5. Pour over the praline, filling up to the rim of the tart base.

## Chocolate Mousse

1. Place a bowl, the whisks, and the cream in the refrigerator.
2. Whip the cream into whipped cream, gradually adding the powdered sugar.
3. Very gently melt the chocolate. When the whipped cream is firm, add the melted chocolate and whisk to incorporate.
4. Pipe onto the ganache and refrigerate.
