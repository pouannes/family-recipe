## Preparing the cigars

1. Mix all the cigar ingredients (pistachio powder, vanilla sugar, powdered sugar, egg, bitter almond extract, spices, and lemon zest), except the brick pastry sheets. Divide into 10 equal-sized balls (about 30 g each).
2. Cut the brick pastry sheets in half, and roll into cigars, folding in the edges. Seal with water.

## Syrup

3. In a small saucepan, bring the honey and orange blossom water to a boil.

## Cooking and finishing

4. Deep-fry the cigars at 190°C until they are golden but not too brown.
5. Gently pat them dry with paper towel, then dip them into the honey saucepan. Turn them over to coat well on all sides.
6. Decorate with crushed pistachios and lemon zest.

<Tip>
  Ground cardamom is optional but adds an extra oriental touch.
