## Steps

1. Cut all the vegetables into large cubes of about 2 cm.
2. Heat a Dutch oven and a large skillet to medium heat (5/9).
3. Slice the chorizo into rounds about 5 mm thick, and set aside 150g.
4. Place the 250g of chorizo in both pans once they are hot enough. Sear on both sides, then remove the chorizo but leave all the rendered fat in the pans.
5. Sear all the vegetables in the chorizo fat. They should get a good color.
6. When the vegetables are nicely browned, gather them all in the Dutch oven. If needed, deglaze the skillet with a little water, and pour the juices over the vegetables.
7. Add the water, thyme and bay leaves. Lower the heat to low (3/9), and let simmer for about 30 minutes. When you poke the tip of a knife into a piece of carrot and lift it, the vegetable should slide off on its own.
8. Using an immersion blender, blend until you get a thick liquid.
9. Add the cream, then season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Before serving, sear the remaining 150g of chorizo (partially cut into quarter slices).
