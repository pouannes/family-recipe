## Steps

1. Toast the puffed cereals for 15 minutes at 150°C.
2. Do the same with the pecans. Roughly chop them.
3. Put the remaining ingredients (glucose, butter, maple syrup, brown sugar, salt, vanilla) in a pan and heat to 115°C.
4. Mix everything together so that each cereal and nut is coated in the syrup.
5. Transfer to a 20x30cm pan lined with parchment paper. Press down firmly and let rest for 2-3 hours.
