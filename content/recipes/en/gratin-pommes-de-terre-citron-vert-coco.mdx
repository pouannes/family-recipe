## Gratin

1. Wash and dry the potatoes. Slice them to 3 mm on a mandoline.

2. In a large dish, combine the potato slices, lime juice and zest, coconut cream, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside at room temperature.

3. Grate the garlic and slice the shallots to 3 mm on a mandoline.

4. Heat the oil over medium heat and slowly cook the garlic and shallots until soft.

5. Preheat the oven to 180°C.

6. In an oven-safe dish, arrange a layer of potatoes followed by a bit of shallots, alternating layers. The last layer should be potatoes, neatly arranged in a rosette pattern.

7. Pour the remaining liquid from the dish where the potatoes rested, along with the vegetable broth.

8. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 40 minutes in the middle of the oven.

## Infused Oil

9. Meanwhile, deseed the chili pepper and cut it into thin strips. Slice the garlic into thin slices, peel the ginger and cut it into small matchsticks. Cut the green part of the spring onions into 5 mm dice.

10. Heat the oil in a small saucepan. Fry the onions for 3 minutes, then remove them and fry the rest for 5 minutes. Reserve the oil.

## Finishing

11. When the gratin is ready, pour the infused oil over it. Spread with a brush, then bake for 30 minutes without aluminum foil.

12. Serve topped with the fried aromatics.
