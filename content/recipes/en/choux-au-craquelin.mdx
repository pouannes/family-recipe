## Craquelin

1. Cream the butter and sugar together.
2. Add the sifted flour and mix quickly until a dough forms.
3. Roll out to 2mm between two sheets of parchment paper.
4. Refrigerate until firm.

## Choux pastry

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C, bottom heat only (not fan-assisted).
2. In a saucepan, combine the water, milk, butter cut into cubes, sugar, and salt. Heat on low until the butter has fully melted.
3. Bring to a boil over high heat.
4. Remove from heat and add all the flour at once. Stir immediately and vigorously with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough forms (the panade).
5. Return to medium heat and dry out the panade by stirring for 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Transfer to a bowl and whisk until the temperature drops to 40-50°C.
7. Beat the eggs lightly. Add them gradually (in about 5 additions) until the right consistency is reached: a smooth, glossy dough that doesn't fall off the spoon all at once when lifted.
8. Transfer to a piping bag and pipe 4 cm diameter choux puffs.

## Assembly and baking

1. Cut the craquelin into 4.5 cm diameter circles and place one on top of each choux puff.
2. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes. Do not open the oven door during baking. Remove the choux when they are golden brown.

<Tip>
  You can add an optional flavoring to the choux pastry: vanilla extract,
  lemon zest, etc.
