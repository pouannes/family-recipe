## Preparation

1. Place a first portion of sugar (90g) + food coloring + water (15g, or 7g water + 8g vanilla extract) in a large skillet over high heat. Bring to a boil, then as soon as the mixture starts to crystallize, add the almonds.
2. Stir well to coat the almonds with sugar. Then let a small amount of the outer sugar melt, stir thoroughly again, and transfer to a bowl. Stir regularly so the almonds don't stick together.
3. Repeat this process 2 more times to form a thick sugar crust around the almonds.
4. Let cool, then store in an airtight container.

<Tip>The process is done in 3 passes: each pass uses 90g of sugar, a touch of food coloring and 15g of liquid (water only or water + vanilla).</Tip>
