## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Mix the almonds and spices together.
3. Cut the filo sheets to the dimensions of the mold (you want 24 sheets in total).
4. Alternate filo sheets and melted ghee for 12 layers.
5. Spread the almond-spice mixture.
6. Alternate filo sheets and melted ghee for 12 more layers.
7. Bake for 25 minutes.
8. Toward the end of baking, bring the remaining ingredients (water, honey, sugar, orange blossom water, lemon juice) to 109°C in a saucepan.
9. As soon as the baklawas come out of the oven, pour the hot syrup over them, spreading it evenly.

<Tip>You can replace the individual spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, ginger) with 1 teaspoon of quatre-epices (four-spice blend).</Tip>
