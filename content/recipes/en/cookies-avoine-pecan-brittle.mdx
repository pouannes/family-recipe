## Pecan brittle

1. If the pecans are not toasted, preheat the oven to 150°C.
2. Cut the pecans into quarters.
3. If needed, toast for 10 to 15 minutes. Be careful not to burn them!
4. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, butter, and water, and cook over medium heat until you get an amber caramel.
5. Remove from heat, add the toasted pecans, and stir well to coat them in caramel.
6. Add the baking soda and salt, stir vigorously to combine everything evenly.
7. Pour onto a baking mat covered with another baking mat and roll out with a rolling pin.
8. Once the brittle has fully hardened, break it into pieces about 1.5 cm across.

## Brown butter

1. Place 171 g of butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir regularly.
2. Cut the remaining 171 g of butter into roughly 2 cm cubes. Set aside in a bowl (the stand mixer bowl, for example).
3. Wait for the butter in the saucepan to turn brown, stirring the bottom of the pan well.
4. When you see many brown specks, pour over the butter in the bowl. Make sure to scrape all the "brown bits" from the bottom of the pan — it's not burnt, that's where the flavor is!
5. Refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes.

## Cookies

1. In a food processor, combine the flour, salt, baking soda, 150 g of rolled oats, and 255 g of brittle. Process until you get a slightly coarse flour.
2. Using the paddle attachment of a stand mixer, cream the butter mixture with both sugars.
3. Add the eggs one at a time, then the yolks one at a time, continuing to mix until smooth.
4. Add the vanilla extract and mix.
5. Add the flour mixture and mix.
6. Add the remaining 150 g of rolled oats along with the 385 g of brittle pieces, and mix to distribute evenly.
7. Using an ice cream scoop, form blobs of about 60 g. Refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours.
8. Cover with a baking mat and flatten the blobs with a rolling pin (to about 1 cm).
9. Bake the desired number for 9 minutes at 175°C, convection.

<Tip>Freeze any cookies you don't bake right away. Take them out 15 minutes before baking (while the oven preheats). Bake for 11 to 12 minutes at 175°C, convection.</Tip>
