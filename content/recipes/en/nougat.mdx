## Preparation

1. Toast the nuts for 15 minutes at 150°C (convection oven).
2. Heat the honey in a small saucepan (it needs to reach 121°C).
3. Heat sugar (1), water, lavender flowers, and glucose syrup in a small saucepan (the mixture needs to reach 156°C).
4. Beat the egg whites (fresh and dehydrated) to stiff peaks, tightening with sugar (2). Time it so they reach the right consistency just before the honey is ready.
5. When the honey reaches 121°C, pour it in a thin stream over the egg whites.
