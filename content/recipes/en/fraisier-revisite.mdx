## Breton shortbread

1. Whisk the yolk and sugar for a few minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.
2. Add the butter and whisk vigorously. Stop as soon as the butter is incorporated.
3. Sift the flour and baking powder. Whisk just enough to incorporate.
4. Roll out to 6 mm thickness inside 7.5 cm diameter rings.
5. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
6. Bake for 20 minutes at 160°C, convection mode, on the second rack from the bottom.
7. Let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Chocolate-vanilla whipped cream

1. Scrape the vanilla seeds. Place them in the heavy cream (optionally with the pod).
2. Bring the cream to a simmer, then immediately turn off the heat. Cover and let infuse for 2 hours.
3. Hydrate the gelatin with the water and refrigerate.
4. Bring the cream back to a simmer.
5. Emulsify with the chocolate in 3 additions.
6. Add the hydrated gelatin and mix until smooth.
7. Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

## Strawberry coulis (optional)

1. Blend the strawberries.
2. Bring the strawberry puree to a boil.
3. Add the pectin mixed with a teaspoon of sugar. Mix well.
4. Add the remaining sugar and continue cooking for 3 minutes, whisking.
5. Transfer to a bowl and add the lemon juice. Mix.
6. Refrigerate.

## Assembly

1. Slice half the strawberries into thin slices, and dice the rest.
2. Whip the chocolate-vanilla cream into whipped cream.
3. Line 7.5 cm diameter, 6 cm tall rings with acetate strips.
4. Arrange the strawberry slices along the inside of the ring.
5. Pipe the whipped cream to one-third of the height.
6. Add diced strawberries and a little coulis.
7. Pipe the whipped cream to 1 cm from the top.
8. Place the Breton shortbread inside the acetate strip, pressing down lightly.
9. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
10. Unmold. Pipe small dots of strawberry coulis on top to decorate.
