## Steps

1. Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add diced onion and sliced bell peppers, cooking until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add minced garlic, cumin, paprika, and chili flakes. Stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
4. Make small wells in the sauce with the back of a spoon. Crack an egg into each well.
5. Cover the skillet and cook on low heat for 5-8 minutes, until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
6. Crumble feta over the top and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve immediately with crusty bread.

<Tip>For a smoky twist, add half a teaspoon of smoked paprika along with the regular paprika.</Tip>
