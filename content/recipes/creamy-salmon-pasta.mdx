## Salmon

1. Place the salmon skin-down on a cold pan. Bring the heat up to medium. Cook about 80% on the skin side, then flip and finish the remaining 20% on the other side — you want the salmon slightly undercooked as it will finish cooking in the pasta later.
2. Set the salmon aside and cut it into bite-sized chunks. Reserve any crispy skin bits separately for topping.

## Sauce

3. Finely slice the garlic cloves. In the same pan, using the rendered fat from the salmon, cook the garlic until golden.
4. Deglaze with the white wine, scraping up any fond. Let it cook until the alcohol has evaporated and the wine has mostly reduced.
5. Add the heavy cream, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper. Stir and let the sauce reduce on low heat for 5–10 minutes until slightly thickened.

## Bringing it together

6. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until quite undercooked — about 2-4 minutes less than the package directions, depending on how al dente you like it. Remember that it will finish cooking in the sauce.
7. About 1–2 minutes before the pasta is ready, add the frozen peas directly into the sauce pan.
8. Transfer the pasta into the sauce along with a generous amount of pasta water. Stir well over medium heat.
9. Once the sauce has reduced to a creamy, not-watery consistency, remove from the heat and stir in the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Mix until smooth and glossy.
10. Gently fold in the salmon chunks. Serve immediately.

<Tip>
  Reserve the crispiest bits of salmon from step 2 and use them as a final
  topping, along with Parmigiano shavings — or both!
