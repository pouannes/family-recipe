## Steps

1. Make the crust by mixing flour, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Rub in cold cubed butter until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and 1-2 tablespoons of ice water, mixing until the dough comes together.
2. Press the dough evenly into a 24cm pie dish, bringing it up the sides. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.
3. Peel, core, and slice the apples thinly. Toss with sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice, and raisins.
4. Prepare the crumble topping by combining flour, brown sugar, and a pinch of cinnamon. Rub in the butter until you get chunky crumbs.
5. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Fill the chilled crust with the apple mixture, mounding it slightly in the center.
6. Scatter the crumble topping evenly over the apples, pressing down gently.
7. Bake for 45-50 minutes until the crumble is golden and the filling is bubbling at the edges. Let cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

<Tip>Use a mix of tart and sweet apples — Granny Smith and Braeburn work beautifully together.</Tip>
