## Steps

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until just short of al dente, about one minute less than the package directions.
2. While the pasta cooks, toast the black pepper in a dry skillet over medium heat for about a minute until fragrant. Add a ladleful of pasta water and let it simmer.
3. Finely grate the pecorino romano into a bowl. Add a few tablespoons of pasta water and stir vigorously into a smooth paste.
4. Transfer the pasta directly into the pepper skillet using tongs, bringing along some pasta water. Toss over low heat for a minute.
5. Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the pecorino paste and toss quickly, adding small splashes of pasta water as needed until you get a creamy, glossy sauce that coats every strand.

<Tip>Work quickly off the heat when adding the cheese — too much heat will make it clump instead of forming a smooth sauce.</Tip>
